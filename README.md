# StringManipulation
This is actually a collection of coding problems from /r/dailyprogrammer that I combined into one source file. The problems all deal with manipulating a variable-length string and are as follows: 1) Write an append function to take a string and a character and append the character to the end of the string. 2) Write a concatenate function that takes two strings and appends the characters of the second string onto the first. 3) Write a function that takes a string and a number and returns the character at that position in the string with the first character in the string numbered zero. 4) Write a function that takes a string, starting position, and length of characters. Return a string starting at the specified position for the specified length. For example, if the string was abcdefg, the position was 3, and the length was 4, then the new string would be cdef. 5) Write a function that takes a string and 2 characters. The first character should be one in the string, and the second should be a replacement. Wherever the first character is in the string, replace it with the second character. 6) Write a function that takes a string, a target, and text to replace the target. The function should replace every occurrence of the target text with the replacement text. For example, if you have string abcdabee, target points to ab, and replacement points to xyz, then the new string should be xyzcdxyzee.
